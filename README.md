### Key Findings

#### 1. Revenue Collapse in Q4 2024

Revenue fell from ~$40–50M monthly to near zero by November—indicating a critical business failure requiring urgent investigation.

**Possible Causes:** supply chain issues, competition, demand shifts, or operational breakdowns.

#### 2. Youth-Dominated Customer Base

Customers aged **18–24** are the top revenue contributors, followed by 25–30 and 31–35 segments—creating both opportunity and volatility.

#### 3. Geographic Concentration

Revenue is concentrated in a few major cities, with New Jersey emerging as the top market in 2024, increasing regional dependency risk.

#### 4. Product Concentration

* Clothing accounts for ~85% of revenue
* Ornaments and other products remain underutilized

#### 5. International Shipping Costs

International orders remain stable (~30%), but shipping costs increased by **475%**, reducing margins.
